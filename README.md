# visual_localization_and_path_planning
The first part of this research article shows the theory behind feature-based localization, and the fundamentals to understand how the pose estimation can be made from matching the matching pixels in two different frames and calculating the fundamental matrix using 8 points algorithm and RANSAC algorithm to estimate the pose of the camera.
The second part is about pathplanning algorithms.
